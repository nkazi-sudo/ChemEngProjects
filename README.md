# ðŸ§ª Chemical Engineering Educational Apps

Welcome to the **Chemical Engineering Educational Apps** repository! This collection of Python and Jupyter-based applications is designed to help chemical engineering students and educators visualize and interactively explore core topics in chemical engineering. 

All apps are built with a focus on **learning**, **interactivity**, and **conceptual understanding**, using tools such as Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, Plotly, PyQt, and Streamlit.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals of This Repository

- Provide **visual and interactive tools** for understanding fundamental chemical engineering concepts.
- Support **self-study and classroom instruction** by bridging the gap between theory and practice.
- Offer **open-source, Python-based resources** that are easy to run, modify, and extend.

## ðŸ§° Current Applications

| App Name                      | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| `vle_plotter`                | Visualize binary vapor-liquid equilibrium diagrams (T-x/y, P-x/y) for ideal and non-ideal systems. |
| `mccabe_thiele_distillation` | Interactive McCabe-Thiele tool to design and analyze binary distillation columns. |
| `numerical_methods`          | Solver demos for Newton-Raphson, Euler's method, Runge-Kutta, Gauss-Seidel, etc. |
| `reactor_design_tool`        | Explore performance of CSTRs, PFRs, and batch reactors using reaction kinetics and energy balances. |

Each tool includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook or standalone Python app.
- Clear explanation of the theory and methodology.
- User interaction or sliders/inputs where applicable.
