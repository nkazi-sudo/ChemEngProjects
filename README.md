# 🧪 Chemical Engineering Educational Apps (Shiny for Python)

Welcome to the **Chemical Engineering Educational Apps** repository! This collection of Python applications is built to help chemical engineering students and educators **visually understand core chemical engineering concepts** using **interactive apps**.

These tools are designed to run inside the **[Shiny for Python Playground](https://shinylive.io/py/)** — so there's **no installation required**! Just copy the code into the playground and run it.

---

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

- Provide free, interactive tools for **learning** and **visualizing** chemical engineering principles.
- Make it easy for students to explore complex ideas using **Shiny for Python** with just a browser.
- Cover a wide range of topics including **VLE**, **distillation**, **reaction engineering**, **numerical methods**, and more.

---

## 📚 How to Use the Apps

1. Visit the [Shiny for Python Playground](https://shinylive.io/py/).
2. Open any `.py` file in this repo.
3. **Copy the entire Python code** from the file.
4. Paste it into the Playground.
5. Click **"Run App"** and start exploring interactively.

> ✅ No setup, no installation, just instant interactivity.

## 🧰 Available Apps

| App Name                      | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| `vle_plotter.py`             | Binary VLE visualization: T-x/y, P-x/y diagrams; ideal vs. non-ideal systems. |
| `mccabe_thiele.py`           | Interactive McCabe-Thiele tool for binary distillation design. |
| `numerical_methods_demo.py`  | Visual demonstrations of Newton-Raphson, Gauss-Seidel, Runge-Kutta, etc. |
| `reactor_models.py`          | Explore CSTR, PFR, and batch reactor performance with kinetic models. |

Each app includes:
- Clear layout with interactive elements (sliders, dropdowns, plots).
- Inline comments and documentation to support learning.
- Simple and clean code written for readability and modification.
